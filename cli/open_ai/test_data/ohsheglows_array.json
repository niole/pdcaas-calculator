While the water heats up, add the coconut milk and matcha powder to a high-speed blender.     Once the water has boiled, remove it from the heat and let sit for 15 seconds. Carefully add it to the blender along with the maple syrup (if using).    If your blender's lid is vented, secure it on top. If you don't have a vented lid, keep the lid slightly ajar so air can escape. Blend on the lowest speed, very slowly increasing to medium, for about 20 seconds until frothy and combined.

You know when you wake up on a chilly morning and need a hot drink  ? Well this is my go-to on fall and winter mornings (or afternoons!) when I want a change from coffee. The thought of this smooth, warm, creamy drink seriously lures me out of my cozy bed. I love how effortless this recipe is, especially on those half-awake, barely functioning mornings (just make sure you're alert enough to operate a blender with hot liquid!). I love matcha green tea powder because it delivers calming, jitter-free energy as well as powerful antioxidants. Be sure to see my Deluxe Version in the Tips section below for a more decadent way to make this beverage-when I want an especially comforting treat, I'll forgo the water and only use canned coconut milk.

Add the ground flax and water to a medium bowl, and whisk until combined. Set aside.    To a large bowl, add the coconut, rolled oats, brown sugar, baking powder, salt, and chocolate chips. Stir to combine.    To the same bowl as the flax mixture, add the peanut butter, vanilla, and maple syrup. Stir until smooth. The mixture will be very thick.    Using a spatula (this helps to scoop up every last bit), scoop the wet mixture on top of the dry ingredients, and stir until thoroughly combined. The batter will be very dry at first, but this is normal! You'll need to put some elbow grease into stirring. I like to knead the dough with my hands to make it all come together. (You can also use electric beaters, but I prefer to get in there with my hands and knead until no dry patches remain.) If for some reason your dough is still too dry to shape into balls, add a teaspoon of water and mix again.   Lightly wet your hands (shaking off excess water) and form about 13 balls, just smaller than golf balls. Stop and rinse off sticky hands as needed. Place each ball onto the prepared baking sheet about 2 to 3 inches apart. Gently press down on each ball to flatten into a  1-cm (just less than 1/2-inch) thick disc. If there are any leftover chocolate chips in the bottom of the bowl, scoop them up and push them into the tops of the cookies.    Bake for 12 to 14 minutes. The cookies tend to only spread out a little. They'll be delicate coming out of the oven, but they will firm up as they cool. The bottoms will be golden. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes before carefully transferring to a cooling rack until completely cooled. Once cooled, the cookies will remain soft and chewy. For a firmer texture, transfer the cookies to the freezer (my favourite way to enjoy them!). Store leftovers in an airtight container or freezer bag in the freezer for up to 1 month. ","description":"crowd-pleasing and family-approved plant-based recipes, healthy recipes free of any animal products.  Peanut butter, shredded coconut, and rolled oats form the base of these soft and chewy chocolate chip cookies. Brown sugar lends a light caramel flavour which pairs so well with the peanut butter and sea salt. They're completely flourless, in addition to being vegan and gluten-free, but no one will be the wiser. You   try these in my   for a decadent summer treat! This recipe is from  (page 213).

Preheat the oven to 400degF (200degC) and line two extra-large (15- x 21-inches) rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. It's important to use extra-large baking sheets so there's enough room for all those healthy veggies.     Divide the chopped, \"to-be-roasted\" veggies onto the baking sheets. Drizzle 1 1/2 tablespoons of oil over top each sheet and toss the veggies until they're fully coated in the oil. Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper.     Roast the veggies for 30 to 40 minutes (I find 35 minutes is perfect in my oven for lightly charred veggies) until fork tender and golden. There's no need to rotate/move the pans or flip the veggies halfway through baking unless you're particular about even cooking.     While the veggies are roasting, add the quinoa to a large pot along with 3 1/2 cups (875 mL) water. Stir. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, then immediately reduce the heat to low-medium, cover with a tight-fitting lid, and cook for 12 to 14 minutes, until the water is absorbed and the quinoa is fluffy. Remove the lid and fluff the cooked quinoa with a fork.     While the quinoa cooks, chop the cucumber and green onions. Rinse the tomatoes (I hold off slicing them until just before serving).     Remove the roasted veggies from the oven. Once mostly cool, transfer all of the veggies and quinoa into containers, seal with airtight lids, and place into the fridge for up to 4 days.     To make the power bowls: Add a couple generous handfuls of chopped lettuce/greens to the bottom of a large shallow bowl. Drizzle with a bit of dressing and toss the lettuce/greens until coated. Top with spoonfuls of your prepped food (quinoa, roasted and fresh veggies) -I always warm up the quinoa and roasted veggies first! Now, add  diced avocado, more salad dressing, cooked beans or lentils, nuts and seeds, and hummus or pesto. Keep the power bowl flavours interesting by c hanging up the toppings each day! ","description":"crowd-pleasing and family-approved plant-based recipes, healthy recipes free of any animal products.  I love having prepped food in the fridge, but don't love doing hours of meal prep each week. So I came up with this simple method that takes just 25 minutes of active prep time. The healthy food components can be enjoyed for several days in power bowls, wraps, and even stirred into soups! Power bowls are so fun for family meals because you can switch up the veggies and toppings to suit each palate, giving kids control to build their own bowls. This recipe is also a handy make-ahead option if you're having friends over for a meal. Simply chop all the veggies the night before and refrigerate them in containers. Just before your guests arrive, pop the veggies into the oven, cook the quinoa, and prep the toppings. After cooking, you can all have fun assembling your own power bowls and everyone will be super impressed by the stunning rainbow-coloured meal!
