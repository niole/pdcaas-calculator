[{"title":"Roasted Broccolini & Cheddar","yields":"Serves 4","ingredients":["11/2 pounds broccolini","Good olive oil","Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper","6 ounces good sharp aged white Cheddar, such as Cabot","Juice of 1/2 lemon"],"instructions":"Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Remove and discard the bottom half of the broccolini stems. Cut the remaining broccolini stems in half or quarters lengthwise, depending on the size of the stems. Don't cut the florets-just pull them apart. Place the broccolini on a sheet pan. Drizzle 4 tablespoons olive oil on the broccolini and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Toss well, making sure the broccolini is lightly coated with oil. Spread the broccolini in one layer and roast for 10 minutes, tossing once with a metal spatula, until crisp-tender. Meanwhile, slice the Cheddar 1/4 inch thick and break it into large crumbles. When the broccolini is ready, sprinkle the cheese on the broccolini and return to the oven for 3 to 4 minutes, just until the cheese melts. Squeeze on the lemon juice, taste for seasonings, and serve hot.","description":"classic american comfort food.

Place a 12-cup standard muffin tin on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine 12 tablespoons of butter and 1/3 cup brown sugar. Place 1 tablespoon of the mixture in each of the 12 muffin cups. Distribute the pecans evenly between the 12 muffin cups on top of the butter & sugar mixture. Lightly flour a wooden board or stone surface. Unfold one sheet of puff pastry with the folds going left to right.  Brush the whole sheet with half of the melted butter. Leaving a 1-inch border on the puff pastry, sprinkle each sheet with 1/3 cup of brown sugar, 11/2 teaspoons of cinnamon, and 1/2 cup of raisins. Starting with the end nearest you, roll the pastry up snugly like a jelly roll around the filling, finishing the roll with the seam-side down. Trim the ends of the roll about 1/2 inch and discard. Slice the roll in 6 equal pieces. Place each piece, spiral side up, in 6 of the muffin cups. Repeat with the second piece of puff pastry. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until the sticky buns are golden brown on top and firm to the touch. Be careful - they're hot! Allow to cool for   invert the buns onto the parchment paper (ease the filling and pecans out onto the buns with a small spoon) and cool completely.","description":"classic american comfort food.
