# UX

user provides information about meals and then we give them stats.

how to provide meal info?
- recipes
- manual input
- text description of meal and then we use an LLM to make up a recipe for them and do analysis on that recipe *

what stats?
- total grams of digestible balanced protein
- percent of protein that was digestible and balanced
- report of what amino acids they were deficient in
- recommendation on what foods to eat

# feedback
- no entry for nutritional yeast in food_info_types
- a lot of things don't have weight entries and it doesn't fail
- chat gpt is bad at making up recipes
